## ðŸ’» EcoEats
EcoEats is a MERN stack web application developed for the Web Software Development course (CS324). It is a food waste management system where restaurants can sell their leftover items for much cheaper.



## ðŸŒ± Development of a Smart Crop Monitoring System
This capstone project is about developing a smart crop monitoring system that records information about the farm and crops, such as the soil's temperature, salinity & pH levels, etc. The collected data can be viewed on an HTML website & an iOS application named MoniCrop.
The following tools were used: Raspberry Pi 4B, pressure sensors, HTML, PHP, Python, SwiftUI & XCode.

GuideForm is an application intended to survey senior engineering college students in Bahrain to expand Tashfeen Engineering Solutions in the Middle East.
The interface also allows the user to access the survey, information about the company & software online, and graphs of the collected data from the survey.



## ðŸš¦ Traffic Lights Controller
This project from the Digital Logic Laboratory course (CMPE 470L) aims to make us implement a traffic light controller using the following tools: VHDL, Intel Quartus IDE software, Terrasic DE-10 Lite board, and other hardware components that can be obtained when necessary for the circuit. The hardware programming was done individually, whereas the circuit was done in pairs.
